### Project Summary: **Transaction Validation System**

This project involves a **NestJS**-based backend application that allows **users** to create transactions and **admins** to validate and update the status of those transactions. It incorporates **authentication**, **authorization**, **transaction management**, and follows best practices for **error handling**, **validation**, and **API documentation** using **Swagger**.

---

### Key Features:

1. **User Authentication and Authorization**:
   - **JWT-based authentication**: Users log in and receive a JWT token, which is required to access protected routes.
   - **Role-based access control (RBAC)**: Admin users have additional permissions to validate transactions, while normal users can only create and view their own transactions.
   - **Guards**: The system uses guards (`JwtAuthGuard`, `RoleGuard`) to protect routes and ensure that only authorized users can perform specific actions.

2. **Transaction Management**:
   - **Create Transactions**: Authenticated users can create transactions, which start with a default status of `PENDING`.
   - **View Transactions**: Users can view all of their own transactions.
   - **Admin Actions**: Admins can:
     - View all **pending** transactions.
     - **Approve** or **reject** pending transactions by updating their status.
   
3. **Validation and Error Handling**:
   - **DTO Validation**: Input data is validated using **class-validator** decorators in the DTOs, ensuring the incoming data meets required standards.
   - **Service-Level Error Handling**: The service layer catches specific errors, such as database uniqueness violations or missing records (e.g., trying to update a non-existent transaction).
   - **Global Exception Filter**: A centralized exception filter ensures that all unhandled errors are caught, logged, and returned in a consistent format without leaking sensitive information.

4. **Swagger API Documentation**:
   - **Auto-generated API documentation**: Swagger is integrated to provide an interactive API interface for developers. The documentation includes descriptions of each endpoint, request/response structures, and examples.
   - **Bearer token authentication in Swagger**: Swagger supports using JWT tokens to test protected routes.

### Project Architecture:

1. **Controllers**:
   - **AuthController**: Handles user login, issuing JWT tokens upon successful authentication.
   - **UsersController**: Allows users and admins to register new accounts with role-based access.
   - **TransactionsController**: 
     - Allows users to create transactions.
     - Allows admins to view pending transactions and update transaction statuses.

2. **Services**:
   - **AuthService**: Responsible for validating user credentials and generating JWT tokens.
   - **UsersService**: Handles user creation, password hashing, and user retrieval.
   - **TransactionsService**: Manages transaction creation, retrieval, and status updates.

3. **Modules**:
   - **AuthModule**: Bundles the authentication logic, including JWT strategy and guards.
   - **UsersModule**: Manages user-related functionalities like registration and credential validation.
   - **TransactionsModule**: Handles all transaction-related operations, including creation and status updates.
   - **PrismaModule**: Manages interaction with the **Prisma ORM** for database access.

4. **Common Utilities**:
   - **Guards**:
     - **JwtAuthGuard**: Protects routes by requiring valid JWT tokens.
     - **RoleGuard**: Restricts access to specific routes based on user roles (e.g., only admins can approve/reject transactions).
   - **Decorators**:
     - **CurrentUser**: Custom decorator that extracts the authenticated user's data from the request.
   - **Filters**:
     - **HttpExceptionFilter**: A global error handler that formats error responses and logs internal server errors.

### Notable Implementations:

1. **Authentication & Authorization**:
   - **JWT Strategy**: Secure login mechanism using JWT tokens to authenticate users.
   - **Role-Based Access**: Admin-only routes are protected using custom role guards.

2. **Transaction Lifecycle**:
   - Users create transactions that start with a `PENDING` status.
   - Admins can view all pending transactions and either approve (`APPROVED`) or reject (`REJECTED`) them.
   - Each transaction is linked to the user who created it and can only be accessed by that user or an admin.

3. **DTOs with Validation**:
   - **`CreateUserDto`**: Validates email, password, and role during user registration.
   - **`LoginDto`**: Validates email and password during login.
   - **`CreateTransactionDto`**: Validates the amount during transaction creation, ensuring it's a positive number.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - **Global Exception Filter**: Standardizes error handling and logging.
   - **Service-Level Error Handling**: Catches specific errors such as:
     - **Unique constraint violations** (e.g., attempting to register with an existing email).
     - **Record not found errors** (e.g., trying to update a non-existent transaction).
   - **Custom Exceptions**: Provides meaningful HTTP exceptions like `BadRequestException`, `ConflictException`, and `NotFoundException`.

5. **Swagger Documentation**:
   - Each route is documented with descriptions, expected request/response formats, and HTTP status codes.
   - JWT authentication is built into Swagger, allowing API testing with protected endpoints.

### Technical Stack:

- **NestJS**: A progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, scalable server-side applications.
- **TypeScript**: Used throughout the project for type safety and improved developer experience.
- **Prisma**: An ORM that simplifies database interactions with PostgreSQL.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Used for secure user authentication.
- **Swagger**: Provides an interactive API documentation interface.
- **Bcrypt**: For password hashing and secure user authentication.
- **class-validator**: Ensures data validation in DTOs to keep input data clean and safe.
- **Docker**: The project can be containerized using Docker for easy deployment and scalability.

### Future Improvements:

1. **Unit and E2E Testing**: Implement unit tests for services and end-to-end (E2E) tests for controllers to ensure robust test coverage.
2. **Notification System**: Integrate push notifications (currently emulated) for transaction status updates to notify users of changes.
3. **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse, especially on critical endpoints like login and transaction creation.
4. **Database Optimizations**: Add indexes to frequently queried fields (e.g., `status`, `userId`) in the transactions table for performance optimization.
